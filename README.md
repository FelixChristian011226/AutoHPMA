> Note: This software is currently developed solely by me, and as I only possess game accounts from the Chinese region, all game recognition features are implemented based on the **Chinese version** of the games. Therefore, support for other languages is not available at this time. At present, the application only supports the **Mumu emulator**, and integration with official launchers or other platforms has not yet been implemented. I sincerely apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Given my limited capability, I warmly welcome any developers who are interested in contributing to this project. Thank you!

**AutoHPMA** is a WPF tool developed in C# designed for the game *Harry Potter: Magic Awakened (HPMA)*, providing simple automation functionalities for players.

<br>

## Features
- **Automated Club Quiz**: Uses PaddleOCR for text recognition and compares it with a built-in question database to automate answering.

<br>
  
## Highlights
